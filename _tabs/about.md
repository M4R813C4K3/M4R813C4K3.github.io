# Matty Davis
**Systems Specialist & Integrated Technologist**

> **"If it has a power button or an IP address, I manage it."**

I am an IT professional defined by a distinctive fusion of technical precision and business communications. I specialize in the end-to-end lifecycle of enterprise technology, sitting at the intersection of infrastructure support and executive-level AV operations. My goal is to not only resolve complex technical issues but to empower users with the knowledge they need to navigate modern systems effectively.

### 📖 The Origin Story
Technology has been a lifelong obsession rather than just a career choice. My journey started in kindergarten with a collection of cereal box CD-ROMs and evolved by middle school into modding Source Engine server code using **C++** and **Lua**. 

Outside of the server room, I maintain a constant curiosity for learning across various domains, with a particular interest in art, history, and geopolitics. I believe that a well-rounded perspective is what allows a technician to become a true problem solver.
